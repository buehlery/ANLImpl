# ALARM example

This directory contains the ALARM example.

## Running

Python3 is required. Running the protocol in this directory requires the built
shared object to be present (see README.md in the parent directory!).
Requirements from the parent README.md are also valid here.

Building: `make debug`.

Running: `./AlarmMain_debug` (plain output) or `./AlarmMain_debug -x`
(XML output)
